# Greenfoot Pong
First project on the 1. semester of Computer Science. We had 1 week to finish this project, I worked together with 3 others in making this project. We used Greenfoot ( https://greenfoot.org/ ) to make this project.

When we recieved the files we had a small game, with very simple game knowledge which means: No menu, no form of velocity for the paddle. Only a paddle that would randomly spawn, and a bit buggy game.

## Features

- Ping pong game mechanics.
- Multiple game modes: 1v1, 1vAI and practice.
- Menu
- Money and level system.
- Store system.
- Cheat system.
