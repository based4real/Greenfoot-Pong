# Greenfoot Pong
First project on the 1. semester of Computer Science. We had 1 week to finish this project, I worked together with 3 others in making this project. We used Greenfoot ( https://greenfoot.org/ ) to make this project.
When we recieved the files we had a small game, with very simple game knowledge which means: No menu, no form of velocity for the paddle. Only a paddle that would randomly spawn, and a bit buggy game.

# Project
We started this project a monday, and finished friday. That includes writing the code for the Game, making a "report" of the project + an UML diagram of the project.
